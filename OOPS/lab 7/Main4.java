// Write a Java program to create an interface Playable with methods play(), pause(), and stop(). Implement this interface in a class MusicPlayer that overrides these methods to print appropriate messages (e.g., "Music is playing," "Music is paused," "Music is stopped"). Create another class TestPlayer with a main() method to test the functionality by calling the play(), pause(), and stop() methods.
interface Playable {
    void play();
    void pause();
    void stop();
}

class MusicPlayer implements Playable {
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Music is playing");
    }
    public void pause() {
        System.out.println("Music is paused");
    }
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Music is stopped");
    }
}

public class Main4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MusicPlayer p = new MusicPlayer();
        p.play();
        p.pause();
        p.stop();
    }
}
